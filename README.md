### 💥 Origin Story (No Filters)

Ever seen someone build full-stack platforms with zero mentorship, no degree, and a 4GB Samsung phone?

Now you have.

No fake bootcamps. No $99 courses. Just pure hunger, curiosity, and hours spent reading source code in bed while the world slept.  
They gave me no tools, so I *became* the toolset.

I'm not here to impress — I'm here to build what I once needed and help others skip the suffering I went through.

### 🧠 What I Bring to the Table (Besides Fire)

- 🪛 Full-stack Dev (HTML / CSS / JS / PHP / Shell / Python)
- 🤖 Telegram Bot Architect (plugin system, admin panel, modular AF)
- 🧱 API engineering with structure and love
- ⚙️ Custom automation for days (Scripts, scrapers, handlers, and crawlers)
- 🧩 Debugging Pro — I see bugs in dreams bro

> I don’t follow documentation. I *become* the documentation.

### 🐍 The Bot That Eats Other Bots

I built what I call one of the most flexible Telegram Bot architectures out there:

- Drop a new feature file into a folder? BOOM — it’s available to the admin inside the bot.
- Every module is a plug-in. Every action can be toggled with the admin panel.
- Easily scalable. Minimal friction. Pure elegance.

> Built solo. Designed with warzone logic. Powered by my belief in impossible.

### 🧬 Mindset: I Think in Blueprints

> “You can't really master a system until you've been forced to build it without knowing how.”

- I don’t just build apps — I build systems.
- My code is structured to survive collapse and built for future collab.
- I build like someone who never had a second chance.  
  That’s because I didn’t.

### 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 Looking For...

- Creators who build with soul
- Teams that value real talent, not just certificates
- People who want to disrupt, not decorate
- Mentors who’d rather grow with me than lecture

---

### 🧠 Fun Facts About Me

- Built my first project by reading GitHub repos — without knowing the language
- Never touched VS Code until a year into my journey
- Don't ask how I debug... Just know I will find the bug 😈
- My phone worked harder than most interns
